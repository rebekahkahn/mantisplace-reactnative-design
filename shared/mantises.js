        description: "This is a small mantis not quite reaching 2 inches, but is very robust! The females have a very pretty lacy underwing. They are commonly called the number 9 mantis, due to the design on their wings. The male is almost the same size as the female, only 1/4 inch smaller. They, in my opinion, do not have a bit appetite. The female lays a quite long ootheca, about 2 times her length. This species is to be kept as a pet and cannot be release into the US."

They need the same care as most mantises, water and food and a nice big home!"
